# Beginner React Portfolio

## Description
The "Beginner React Portfolio" is a personal portfolio website built using the React framework, designed to showcase my introductory web development skills and projects. As a beginner in the field, this portfolio serves as a platform to exhibit my progress, experience, and passion for web development.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring seamless viewing across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Users can switch between dark and light modes, enhancing readability and creating a visually appealing experience.
- **Navigation:** A user-friendly navigation menu allows easy access to different sections of the portfolio, including Home, About, Skills, Works, and Contact.
- **About Me:** The "About" section provides insights into my background, skills, and experience, helping visitors get to know me better.
- **Skills Showcase:** The "Skills" section highlights the technologies and tools I'm proficient in, showcasing my technical capabilities.
- **Projects Display:** The "Works" section presents a collection of my recent projects, each with a brief description, links to demos, and source code.
- **Contact Form:** The "Contact" section features a simple contact form through which visitors can reach out to me, fostering potential collaborations and connections.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my foundational knowledge of web development, particularly in using React components, state management, and responsive design principles. The portfolio not only acts as a digital resume but also reflects my commitment to continuous learning and growth in the field of web development.

## Technologies Used
- React: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Icons: Library providing a wide range of icons for visual enhancements.
- React Router: Enables navigation and routing within the portfolio.
- CSS (with Tailwind CSS): Styling for a clean and modern design.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the portfolio's content.

## Future Enhancements
As my skills evolve, I plan to expand the "Beginner React Portfolio" by adding more advanced features, refining the design, and incorporating additional projects. Continuous learning and improvement will be reflected in both the content and functionality of the portfolio.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
